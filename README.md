# conference_track_management

### problem:

You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.
* The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
* Each session contains multiple talks.
* Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish before 12 noon, for lunch.
* Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
* The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
* No talk title has numbers in it.
* All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
* Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.

Note that depending on how you choose to complete this problem, your solution may give a different ordering or combination of talks into tracks. This is acceptable; you don’t need to exactly duplicate the sample output given here.

### program design:
1. 通过文件的方式读取输入talkList
2. 将talkList的时间通过从大到小的排序，优先安排时间长的talk
3. 计算talkList总时长，除以每天7小时工作时间，算出需要安排talks的天数
4. 先安排天数的上午session，再安排下午session，优先满足早上条件需要满足12:00整结束，当天数不满1天时，可以不必满足早上必须12:00结束
5. 安排下午session时，若天数不满一天时，可以不必满足下午16:00之后，17:00之前结束
6. 根据得到的conferenceList进行格式化输出，12:00PM和17:00PM固定输出
